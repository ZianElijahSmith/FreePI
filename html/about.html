    <h1>About FreePI</h1>
    <p>Welcome to FreePI, a package index that only includes and
    proposes <a href=
    "https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
    software</a>. Our mission is to provide an index for people to
    share and discover software that respects users' freedoms.</p>
    <p>At FreePI, we believe that nonfree software is unethical.
    Nonfree software is software that doesn't respect users'
    freedoms. It typically restricts users' ability to use, study,
    share, and modify the software in some way. This means that
    nonfree software can be used to control and restrict users,
    rather than empowering them.</p>
    <p>We believe that users have the right to control their
    computing, and that nonfree software takes away that control.
    When you use nonfree software, you're effectively giving up
    control of your computer to the developers of the software.</p>
    <p>We believe that free software is essential to maintaining
    fair and just society. By using FreePI, you can be sure that
    you're only using and promoting free software, and you can be
    confident that your computer is under your control.</p>
    <p>Thank you for using FreePI, and we look forward to working
    with you to promote and support free software!</p>
